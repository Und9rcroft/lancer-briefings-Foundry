#### Background
Larry Lobsterson, better known as "Lobster" is a mech pilot of questionable origin and even more questionable tactics. Hailing from the deep waters of the culinary battlefield, Crimson Claw has taken the mech-piloting world by storm with his unorthodox, seafood-themed combat strategies.

#### Mech Overview: Buttered Justice
SEAFOOD SUPREMACY, the custom mech dubbed "Buttered Justice," is a one-of-a-kind creation tailored for culinary and combat excellence. Key features include:

- **Lobster Claw Manipulators:** Heavy-duty claws designed for cracking shells… and enemy armor.
- **Butter Cannon:** Fires streams of molten butter, making enemies both slippery and delicious.
- **Salt Shaker Grenades:** Explosive canisters loaded with pure sodium chloride, ensuring salty destruction.
- **Thermal Steamer Core:** Doubles as both a weapon and a mobile kitchen for field rations (seafood only).

#### Operational History
Crimson Claw’s missions are as eccentric as the pilot himself. Highlights include:

- **Operation Crustacean Domination:** Liberated an underwater colony with the Buttered Justice’s claws and charisma.
- **The Battle of Bay Seasoning:** Repelled an invading force while generously seasoning their mechs mid-combat.
- **Bisque Barrage Incident:** Accidentally turned a pirate fleet into a giant bowl of lobster bisque. Delicious, but unintentional.

#### Psychological Profile
Crimson Claw is as chaotic as his culinary creations. With a sense of humor sharper than his mech's claws, he approaches every battle with a mix of levity and lethal intent. While often underestimated due to his bizarre antics, his combat effectiveness cannot be ignored—he’s a professional, even if he’s a little butter-crazed.
